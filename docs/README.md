# Macro-Magic
Macro-Magic (`MM`) is a header-only library with a macro `MM_APPLY` to invoke a
specified macro on each of up to 21 arguments. There's also `MM_APPLY_WITH_FIXED_ARG`
to pass a specified fixed first argument to the invoked macro, and there's `MM_NARGS`
to count the number of arguments passed to a variadic macro. And `MM_CAT` to
concatenate with expansion.
